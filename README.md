# BellyButton Biodiversity

## Summary

This project demonstrates how JavaScript, Plotly and D3 can be utilized to create interactive visualizations hosted on GitHub Pages which can be shared with others.

A data file representing bacterial cultures identified in the belly buttons of a sample of subjects, indentified only by an ID number, has been provided. The data file includes the id numbers, metadata associated with the donor, and the bacterial cultures and quantities identified.  The published website would allow an individual donor to explore their data by searching for their ID number.
